About the job
Engineered Arts is the leading manufacturer of full-size humanoid robots used for entertainment, education and communication. With 20 years of hardware and software development, our robots have been sold in over 30 countries worldwide with customers such as NASA, PwC, Meta and many more.


About the Role



The Robotics Software Engineer will be responsible for developing locomotion algorithms and ensuring real-time control stability for dynamic walking robots. This role involves collaboration with other engineers to optimize motion strategies and integrate various sensors for accurate feedback.




Responsibilities



Develop locomotion algorithms - Implement algorithms for gait planning, state estimation, and balance control
Simulation & testing - Validate software using physics-based simulations
Sensor data processing - Utilize IMUs, force sensors, and cameras for robot perception
RTOS integration - Develop software modules for real-time robot control




Required Skills



Strong programming skills in C/C++ and Python
Experience with RTOS (ROS), Gazebo, and real-time locomotion algorithms
Experience with real world hardware
Simulation & real-world testing - Work in both physics-based simulations and real hardware for validation and performance optimization




Our internal motto is â€˜Be Wowâ€™, everything we do is fun, entertaining or surprising to encounter. We always push the boundaries of what is possible in humanoid robotics, researching and developing new systems and techniques to further their appeal. We explore and challenge the human perception of robots as well as the fear and discomfort and the excitement and joy life-like mechanical humanoids present.
